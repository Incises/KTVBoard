# KTV Board
This is the final project for the Embedded System Design course in October 2022, which achieved the function of a KTV jukebox with audio playback and real-time microphone input mixing recording. There was an expansion board, which has an external microphone input and a LED breathing light indicating the real-time volume, attached to the original STM32F746G-DISCO kit.
